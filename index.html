    <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
    <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
    <h4>
        <h1 id="day1">Day 1</h1>
        <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em>right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little vistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>
        </p>
        <h2 id="day2">Day 2</h2>
        <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! we went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="day3">Day 3</h3>
        <p>The picture below is of me visting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures inculding those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin and Alfred Barye.
